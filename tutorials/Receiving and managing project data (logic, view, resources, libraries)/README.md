# Receiving and managing project data (logic, view, resources, libraries)
In Sketchware, project data is divided into files `file`, `view`, `resource`, `logic`, `library`.
### logic
The `logic` file stores data about the project logic: events, moreblocks, variables.
### view
The `view` file stores data, oddly enough, about the view in projects (individual widgets (like fab or drawer) 
or the entire activity at once).
### resource
The `resource` file stores data about the project resources: images, fonts, sounds.
### library
The `library` file stores data about active and inactive libraries in a project.
### file
The file `file` is responsible for listing all activities, custom views.
